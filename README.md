# PDF question-answering chatbot üó£Ô∏èüìÑ
A relatively simple NLP 'chatbot' able to comprehend user query and answer based on information in a given PDF file. Making good use of Haystack v1.25's ready-to-use ExtractiveQAPipeline to retrieve relevant excerpts and passing it to the reader for further comprehension. The answers are then scored and presented to the user.

This project **does not** make use of OpenAI's API nor any other API calls.

How it works:
- Extracts corpus (text) data from a PDF
- Using TextIndexingPipeline, convert corpus into haystack document object and store them in a DocumentStore
- Initialise BM25Retriever and FARMReader
- Connect retriever and reader using ExtractiveQAPipeline
- Run the pipeline and predict the answer to a given query
